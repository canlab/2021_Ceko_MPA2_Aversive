## Neural architecture of negative affect: common and stimulus type-specific representations

### Summary and requirements 

This repository contains MATLAB code used to develop, evaluate and test in new individuals the common and stimulus-type specifc predictive brain models of negative affect, using 4 types of aversive stimuli (mechanical pain, thermal pain, aversive sound, aversive picture). 

- code runs ok on MATLAB 2019b
- code requires CANLAB core tools and a few other tools, all loaded using a2_mc_set_up_paths.m
- main inputs and outputs of these analyses are in the 'results' dir on Dropbox (for access, contact Marta at marta.ceko@gmail.com):
